This has been one of my favorite sites for years now. There is something about the minimalistic yet powerful content that this site provides through their visually pleasing design. There is a great range of what one might call 'happy colors' which are not overpowering by their accompanied black text. Images on the site are clean and seperated by the perfect amount of space throughout the layout of the site. I appreciate the fact that the site uses signifiers when hovering over a certain image or article so the user knows that it is clickable. Their design theme is on I always draw inspiration from when creating my own projects. I feel that the designers of the mindbodygreen website put a lot of effort into making users gain a 'feel good' sense when browsing the lifestyle media brand. 

#Robinhood

Robinhood is known for their simple, yet super sleek UI and icons both on their mobile app and website. Robinhood uses minimal color, but that is what makes their site so appealing. With their usage of mint green they are able to bring users attention to the most important things on their site. The example Robinhood is able to convey is that sometimes, less is more. One thing I appreciate about this site is that they inform users about the services they provide. With a small scroll, a user has the option to 'Learn' about their financial options guided by an exquisite design experience. Though they may have a more simplistic web design compared to others we see, they capture visitors attention and gain loyalty through their sophisticated design techniques.

#Lyft

Right when a user is directed to the lyft site, they are drawn into the crisp and clear image covering their screen. These images portray lyft as a convenient and fun experience enhancing service, which it is! I enjoy that the site is direct in its options to choose from, and concise and to the poiand a 3D theme that keeps the website exciting to a user. Lyft, like Robinhood, uses neutral colors with pops of bright neon pink and purple, to draw the user in and maintain their brand identity. I think the 3D graphics and animations that Lyft includes sets them apart from competitors because it is something the user is not used to seeing everyday. I also love the font Lyft uses on their website because it is so simple, yet bold with the size of the characters and color incorporation. I have used inspiration from the Lyft site for design ideas in my past work.
