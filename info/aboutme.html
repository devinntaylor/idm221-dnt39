I am a student at Drexel University studying <b> Interactive Digital Media </b> and <b> Technology Innovation </b>. I am passionate about the connection between technology and design which makes it possible for developers and designers to deliver the best possible experience for users, resulting in habit forming products. Drexel's campus is conveniently located next to Philadelphia, which allows students to take a deeper dive into and explore their studies and interests in the heart of a Center City. This opens plenty of doors for experiential learning opportunities through the Drexel CO-OP Program which I will be completing in Spring/Summer of 2021.

I have experience with User Interface Design, User Experience Design, and Code Styling in React Native. I am also proficient in programs such as Adobe Xd, Illustrator, Photoshop, Sketch, and InVision. Relevant coursework I have taken to the industry includes User Interface I and II, Interaction Design, Human Computer Interaction, Web Authoring, and Technology Innovation to name a few. My cirriculum at Drexel University continues to strengthen my creative problem-solving skillset that I am eager to apply to the advancing technological world. Through my rigorous course of study, I aim to promote business and product growth with a consumer-centric mindset.

I currently work at a startup company called <b> VyB Technologies </b>, which was founded by three other Drexel students. My role at VyB is <b> Head of Experience Design </b>, where I focus on creating the best possible experiences for our users on the app. I am also constantly brainstorming new ideas our company can implement to set ourselves apart from other startups and  applications. VyB has strengthened and contributed so much to my knowledge and understanding of the startup culture, as well as shown me what working with a great team of hardworking individuals is like. It's awesome.

In my free time I enjoy playing with my two golden retrievers Casey and Cooper, who never fail to make me smile. I also love going to the beach as much as I can, I don't mind if its winter! I am always trying to get outdoors and explore different areas in city of Philadelphia. Lastly, and most importantly, nothing beats spending time with friends and family. My dream is to one day work and reside in Silicon Valley, California.
