                    <p> 
                    I am a student at Drexel University studying <b> Interactive Digital Media </b> and <b> Technology Innovation.</b> I am passionate about the connection between technology and design which makes it possible for developers and designers to deliver the best possible experience for users, resulting in habit forming products. My cirriculum at Drexel University continues to strengthen my creative problem-solving skillset that I am eager to apply to the advancing technological world. I will be completing my Drexel CO-OP in Spring/Summer of 2021. Through my rigorous course of study, I aim to promote business and product growth with a consumer-centric mindset.

                <h3>Web Design</h3>
                <p>
                    I have successfully completed web design projects in my user interface I and II classes at Drexel. My first project dealt with completely redesigning the UI and experience of a local pizza shop website in my hometown. My second project was to redesign a blog website of choice and have it be responsive with multiple animations on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

                <h3>Product Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Working to solve a problem is what designers and technologists aim to do everyday. My interaction design class prompted me and my group to solve the frustrating problems the Septa System embodied and redesign it to deliver the best possible experience to its millions of daily users.
