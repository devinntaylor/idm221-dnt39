        This project built upon my skills from UI I and added componenets of animation in the Flinto software along with accessibility regulations for not only desktop, but tablet and mobile devices. I focused on typography as a main style element of this blog to test my abilities and learn a new technique. My final product includes an interactive and responsive fashion blog with a simple layout and color palette.
