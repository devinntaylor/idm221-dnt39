<h3> User Interface Design I </h3> 
    <p> 
    Covered design, prototyping, and evaluation of graphical user interfaces by exploring topics like human capabilities, input technologies, heuristic evaluation, design methods, principles, and rules. I was taught proper ways to design aesthetically pleasing user interfaces, covering important design principles (learnability, visibility, error prevention, efficiency, and visual design) and the human capabilities that motivate them (including perception, motor skills, color vision, attention, and human error).
